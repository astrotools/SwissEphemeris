# Fixed stars brighter than Magnitude 5 
# This file is based on data provided by S. Moshier.
# 7 Mai 1999:
# File was improved by Valentin Abramov, Tartu, Estonia in April 1999.
# - The stars are ordered by constellation.
# - Most names come from Arabic and have several transliterations, 
#   e.g. Algieba and Al Jabhah. In such cases, the record has been 
#   duplicated and both spellings have been given.
# 
# 11 Jan 2006 (Dieter Koch):
# File updated with star positions from the SIMBAD Astronomical Database.
# http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid
# 
# The Galactic Center was taken from 
# The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 518, Issue 1, pp. L33-L35.
#
# The data are:
# traditional name (no leading blanks in field)
# nomenclature name (no leading blanks in field)
# equinox (must be either '1950' or '2000' or 'ICRS')
# right ascension hours
#               minutes
#               seconds
# declination   degrees
#               minutes
#               seconds
# proper motion in right asc., time seconds per century * cos(decl0)
#               in decl., arc seconds per century 
# radial velocity in km/s
# annual parallax
# magnitude
# DM zone (Durchmusterung zone; declination 1900)
# DM number

# To achieve higher speed for swe_fixstar(), you can copy the

# The following stars are given first to avoid that swe_fixstar() 
# return e.g. Denebola when Deneb is required.

# note, proper motion RA given by AA11 (-3678.06mas/yr) includes the 15cos(de0)
# factor, whereas AA06 (50.315s/cy) doesn't do so. 
# The Swiss Ephemeris from version 1.77 on divides the proper motion in RA 
# as given in this file by cos(de0). 
# AA06: proper motion RA by -50.315"/cy corresponds to -24.520 great circle
